# Welcome to popQuiz!

##popQuiz! is a trivia app that draws upon user generated content.

Users may submit custom quizzes as well as take quizzes submitted by other users.


A deployed prototype of the app can be viewed here:

Besides the obvious HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, this app was built using:

-AngularJS </br>
-JQuery </br>
-Underscore.js </br>
-Cookies.js </br>
-Foundation.css </br>
-Font-Awesome.css </br>

I constructed the backend using parse.com.
