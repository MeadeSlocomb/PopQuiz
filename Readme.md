# Welcome to popQuiz!

##popQuiz! is a trivia app that draws upon user generated content.

Users may submit custom quizzes as well as take quizzes submitted by other users.


A deployed prototype of the app can be viewed here:

Besides the obvious HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, this app was built using:

AngularJS
JQuery
Underscore.js
Cookies.js
Foundation.css
Font-Awesome.css

I constructed the backend using parse.com.
